        <p>Dennis Ritchie developed C at Bell Labs in the early 1970s as an improved B designed by Ken Thompson. Brian Kernighan, a fellow Bell Labs worker, was the one who penned the initial C tutorial and convinced Ritchie to collaborate on a language book. The majority of the "expository" content in the book would be written by Kernighan, with Ritchie's reference manual serving as an appendix.

            The first publicly accessible book on the C programming language was the first edition, which was released on February 22, 1978. Its C version is commonly referred to as K&R C (after the writers of the book), frequently as a way to distinguish it from the later C version that was standardised as ANSI C.
            
            The book's second edition, revised to address language modifications brought about by the then-new ANSI C standard, was released in April 1988. Notably, it included reference material on standard libraries. Since then, the book's second edition—which is also the most recent as of 2023—has been translated into more than 20 languages. The second edition was released as an eBook in 2012 in PDF, Mobi, and ePub formats.
            
            Since its initial standardisation in 1989 (as ANSI X3.159-1989), ANSI C has undergone multiple changes. The most recent revision was accepted as an ANSI standard in June 2018 and is known as ISO/IEC 9899:2018, sometimes known as C17 or C18.
            
            However, no new edition of The C Programming Language has been issued to cover the more recent standards.</p>
